                        <p>In May 2018 Laura and Tim took over Snow Denn Lodge. Plenty of 
                            inspiration and a new, fresh vibe has been brought to Snow Denn
                             Lodge, which is slowly being updated and rejuvenated. 
                            With a passion for all things outdoors and participating in nearly
                             every activity that Methven & Mt Hutt have to offer these two are

                            <p class="leftAligned">In May 2018 Laura and Tim took over Snow Denn Lodge. Plenty of inspiration and a new, fresh vibe has be brought to Snow Denn Lodge, which is slowly being updated and rejuvenated.
                                With a passion for all things outdoors and participating in nearly every activity that Methven & Mt Hutt have to offer these two are the people you want to talk to about things to see and do in the area.  </p>
                        <h4 class="rightAligned">Happy (and warm) Guests</h4> 
                            <img class="textimages rightAligned" src="images and icons/rooms slideshow.jpeg" alt ="image of snowy lodge">
                            <p class="rightAligned">During the Winter we have had some amazing guests stay with us and enjoy the beautiful Winter we have had up Mt Hutt. We look forward to sharing the Summer with many more guests who wish to make the most of Methven's stunning walks, hikes and Mountain Bike trails.</p>
                        <h4 class="leftAligned">Methven's Summer Attractions</h4>
                            <img class="textimages leftAligned" src="images and icons/carousel4.jfif" alt ="image of methven bush walk">
                            <p class="leftAligned">If you haven't experienced Methven and Mt Hutt in Summer you are missing out. With our outstanding DownHill and Cross-Country Mountain bike tracks which have been developed up Mt Hutt there's not a better place to be and why not relax and unwind at the brand new Opuke Hot Pools located just 5 minutes from the lodge. Along with this we have some of the most beautiful clear blue lakes which host an abundance of fish. And some of New Zealand's best walks can be found here along with the Te Arora trail sidling along the side of Mt Hutt.</p>
                        <h4 class="rightAligned">Why Choose Us?</h4> 
                            <img class="textimages rightAligned" src="images and icons/whyus.jpeg" alt ="picture of laura and tim on the slopes">
                            <p class="rightAligned">You might ask what set us apart from all the other accommodation places in Methven.

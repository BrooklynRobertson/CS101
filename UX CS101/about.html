                <p>In May 2018 Laura and Tim took over Snow Denn Lodge. Plenty of 
                    inspiration and a new, fresh vibe has been brought to Snow Denn
                     Lodge, which is slowly being updated and rejuvenated. 
                    With a passion for all things outdoors and participating in nearly
                     every activity that Methven & Mt Hutt have to offer these two are
                      the people you want to talk to about things to see and do in the
                       area.
